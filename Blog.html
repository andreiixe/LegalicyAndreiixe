            <p>Look, I'm writing a blog here because it's nice to read your poorly made blog on Windows 98. Yes, the development of this website was easier than I thought, honestly it's easier, yes anyway everything is hidden on the website so welcome here.</p>

            <p>I went to the legacy website to make some small changes and to fix some bugs, but the reason is because I don't have a phone and I wasted a lot of time, but I will try to make updates.</p>

            <p>Well, these days I haven't really done who knows what, yes, I had to redo the whole website to be compatible with old browsers. Honestly, it took a while to redo everything with a mac os 9 emulator.</p>

            <p>Look at me after a month of distance updating the legacy website, after I write this I will add a tab of links for websites for the old systems. Anyway, there will be a big change soon, maybe when I have free time from high school. Anyway, I will continue to work on the project and always another project.</p>

            <p>Here's another update, i.e. build 110. It wasn't a lot of work, but from what I've documented, I managed to make a similar thread to the main website, i.e. andreiixe.github.io. Little changes here or there. Bug fixes. And nothing else.
                But looking at my personal life, I managed to buy a graphics tablet and a monitor to draw in my spare time. If I start to cause the high school.</p>
