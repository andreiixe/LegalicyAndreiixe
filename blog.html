                        <p>Welcome to my own hell, how could I not write code in high school:). Anyway, I'm trying to make a version of the website in Darkmode , yes, I'm still working (honestly, it's a little harder. The first versions will be in alpha). The rest is that I'm have netflix and youtube premium, somehow I can afford to pay with my 200 lei ($44). Btw, I'm make the house more technological, with light bulbs, Google Home Stuff and etc..., so far I've spend about 900 lei (198 USD) on there things. After I'm done with everthing, I'il think about baccalaureate with study music in the background :)))</p>

                        <p>Did you forget about me? Of course, I disappeared for days. Yes, damn high school doesn't let me have time, I have ideas for the website. but I still make an update here and there. Anyway, I fixed some small bugs on the blog and the link from the host. And I have so much new. There are not too many things, I hope to succeed, I'm taking a break from everything. Anyway, due to high school, I don't really have any drawings anymore, so there are no new ads. I try to come back soon with new things and maybe do that blog development once ;(.</p>

                        <p>Welcome to the 2nd day of throwing from the bridge. A a a I found a bug on the new browsers, as the gif images remain the same because of cookies. *sigh* But anyway, I'm coming soon with something new, like the development blog where I can write anything experienced and studied by me (some things can be wrong) that's all I have and I gave the idea that it supports 4.03, for what reason ? I want to implement a search in js full js. And yes, I want to jump off a bridge 45 times XD (btw it's just a joke :]]])</p>

                        <p>Ahhh.. you won't realize what blog I wrote before editing, and I was about to fall off my chair. How I always end up editing this blog only when I update the website. I added the driver I forgot about the graphics, why didn't I add it the first time? the host simply doesn't allow me to add files larger than 10mb (it's bullshit), anyway, it wasn't a big problem, I archived in WinRAR. But I didn't make any other changes except for the home, because I moved it to be in that cool style.
                            But I forgot to say that I deleted alpha versions of the website in php, because I encountered other problems :))), I love my life, sometimes I want to throw myself off a bridge because of these bugs. That's all I have in this episode of my life. see you in another update :)))))))...</p>

                        <p>Look, I'm coming back with what seems to be an update made by me, honestly the whole website was redone from scratch based on old aol.com. I worked all day for this update. I stabilized the code and ordered things. It was a lot of work, but I have to learn Romanian, some work that I need for my baccalaureate</p>
